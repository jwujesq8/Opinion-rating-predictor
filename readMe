Opinion Rating Predictor



 -> Overview

The "Opinion Rating Predictor" is a Python script that uses linear regression to predict opinion ratings based on textual reviews. It leverages the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks and Pandas for data manipulation.



 -> Dependencies

Python 3.10
pandas
scikit-learn



 -> Code Structure

* mini_dataset_1000.csv
Example dataset file (books reviews).
Due to the fact that the downloaded database is very large (2.6 GB), I use only part of it to train the model. I read 100 examples (chunksize=100) 10 times. In total, my database consists of 1000 examples.

* run.py
Main script file containing the implementation.



 -> Functionality

* get_mini_dataset():

Now this function is commented out. It was used just to trim a large database and save part of it in the mini_dataset_1000.csv.

* load_data_from_file():

Reads the dataset (mini_dataset_1000.csv) and extracts review texts and corresponding scores.

* prepare_train_and_test_data(review_and_score):

Splits the data into training(80%) and testing(20%) sets, performs TF-IDF vectorization on the training data, and returns relevant variables.

* train_model(x_train, y_train):

Trains a linear regression model using the provided training data.

* test_model(test_data, vector, model):

Tests the trained model on a subset of the data, displaying predicted scores alongside actual scores for comparison.

* main():

Orchestrates the entire process by calling the above functions in sequence.
